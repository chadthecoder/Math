# Math
   * Run make and make clean to compile.
   * List of files:
   * 1. mod, pass in two numbers that are doubles. The cpp stl doesn't really have this for doubles.
   * 2. gcd, give gcd from two numbers that are integers.
   * 3. isPrime, lets you know whether a number is prime or not
   * Works on at least Linux if C++ is installed.
   * 1. Run "make" from cppMath folder
   * 2. Add bin folder to path
   * 3. Profit (run "mod", "gcd", or "isPrime")
